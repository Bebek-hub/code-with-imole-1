<h1> My experience </h1>
<p> Due to my interest in coding, I opted in for web development and fate made me come across a group named <q class="quote">Code with Imole</q>. Today, I will be talking about my experience so far with them. </p>

<h3> The Journey so far </h3>
<p> The first class commenced in the second week of January. It started with getting to know about programming, internet, web and email.</p>
<p> This is my first technical assignment. I have to write some codes and upload it on Github pages. </p>

<p> Below is my picture</p>

<h3> The way ahead</h3>
<p> Well, I'm not sure how to combine this class with my academics but I have to make the sacrifice and burn my candle to be a diligent student.</p>
<p> I will not give up, I'll strive till I achieve my goal of being a developer.</p>
<p> A very big thank you to the organizers and facilitators of this wonderful group.</p>
<p> Thank You!!!</p>
